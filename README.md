This was refactored by 30CodeMaker based on the paper Self-Attentive Sequential Recommendation and based on the pytorch version of SASRec code by the pmixer authors, The idea of refactoring the pmixer author's code came about because 30CodeMaker felt that some parts of the pmixer author's code were quite unfriendly to readers (just 30CodeMaker's personal opinion).

30CodeMaker found that the code of pmixer version was not built strictly according to the neural network structure of the original paper in the process of reconstruction, and used a few tricks. Therefore, the code of 30CodeMaker version is built strictly according to the neural network structure of the original paper (only according to 30CodeMaker's understanding of the original paper). The final results show that the effect is slightly worse than the pmixer version (it is possible to fully imitate the tricks used by the pmixer code to be equal to it, of course, 30CodeMaker did not try it, interested readers can give it a try, if you can feedback to 30CodeMaker, thank you!)

Please feel free to point out bugs in the code by contacting me in the github comments or at curryugly30@gmail.com
